## Problem Statement
College students and independent workers struggle to sustain deep focused work due to a lack of accountability & distracting habits.
Existing screen time tools are private & passive, so they don’t tap into the motivating power of peer accountability or friendly competition.

## Goals

1. Creating an engaging interface that gamifies the reduction of screen time while not overwhelming the user.

2. Creating incentives for the user to keep using the application + Targeting user’s competitiveness

# Key Interactions

**Phase 1: Navigating from the home page & accessing individual data**
> Before accessing the core features of our application, it felt necessary to prototype how a user would initially navigate our application. The goal of phase 1 is to display an individual's screen time data and additional user-individual data. Mainly, one can interact with the many buttons from screen b to view information about an individual's screen time usage. Additionally, tapping the user button on the bottom right will map a user to screen e, which will give an overview of a user’s profile and current screen time goals.

**Phase 2: Forming Groups & Adding Friends**
> One of the core features of our application is the ability to interact with friends/groups, and create weekly leaderboards. This phase will use screens b -> a -> c to show an individual how to form groups/view their groups, interactions like adding friends, setting weekly wagers, and viewing weekly recaps based on a groups screen time data.

**Phase 3: Sending Flares**
> The second core feature we wanted to highlight in our prototype was the flare system. A user can walk through this process by going from screen b to d, using the fire button seen in the nav bar. Within the flare screen, the user has access to try many features and buttons– namely, sending out flares and viewing flares their friends/groups sent out. 

> *flares are essentially a ping you send to your friends that indicate you are looking for a body double or study buddy*
