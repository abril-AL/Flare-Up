# Flareup Final Blog
### Project Motivations
The origin of `flareup` came as a means to tackle issues of self-learning technology and the current problems with the state of self-learning among individuals. When thinking through our project and conducting user interviews, our group realize the core problem was not necessarily related to the current self-learning innovations— the core problem of self-learning is rooted in productivity.

`flareup` is motivated by users such as college students & independent workers who deeply value accountability in order to stay productive. As a team, we hope to mitigate issues relevant to holding deep focus when working. Additionally, we want to reduce the average screentime among users of our application, which we aim to do so with a gameified productivity experience.

### Problem Statement
> Many individuals struggle to sustain focused work due to distracting habits & a lack of accountability. 
> Existing screen time tools are private & passive, so they don’t tap into the motivating power of peer accountability or friendly competition.
